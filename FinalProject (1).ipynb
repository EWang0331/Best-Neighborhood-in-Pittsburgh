    "Based on the data from this crime-based dataset, the \"best neighborhood\" is Mt. Oliver Boro with only 101 crimes. North Shore is ranked 65 with a total of 3728 crimes, which puts it in the lower-middle side of the rankings. This doesn't really surprise me since there it's sort of a high-volume area with a lot of people passing through it every day. This is probably because it is located in the middle of Pittsburgh and there are many attractions in the neighborhood."

North Shore is tied for 17th with 3 parks, which is in the upper-middle side of the rankings. This kind of surprised me because North Shore is one of the smallest neighborhoods in pittsburgh, so I was expecting it to have a lot less parks than other neighborhoods."

North Shore scored really low and has lots of apartments instead of houses. There was also not enough data on North Shore to be able to determine whether or not North Shore has bad or good housing."

This didn't surprise us much because we were expecting it to be around the middle fo each dataset. The actual best neighborhood, based off of our datasets was Central Northside, with a total rank of 51. To find total rank we just added up the ranks from each of the datasets and put them in order from lowest to highest totals."
